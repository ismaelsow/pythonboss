        <p>I'm so happy you chose Python Boss to embark on your data science journey. Under 24 hours (usually earlier than that), you'll receive an email with everything you need to access the material.</p>
        <p>Why the delay? I'm still doing many things manually, so they take a little more time to be ready, like a delicious home-made strawberry cake. 🍰</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a few minutes you should get your invoice from Stripe, the billing platform I use. And if you have any questions, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:pythonboss@userstand.com">pythonboss@userstand.com</a></p>
        <p>See you soon!</p>
