<h2>The Python Boss course</h2>

<div class="intro">
  <p><span style="font-weight:800">Ismaël here 👋</span></p>
  <p>We're so happy you chose us to help you upgrade your Python data analysis and data visualization skills. Under 24 hours (usually earlier than that), you'll receive an email with everything you need to access the material.</p>
  <p>Why the delay? We're still doing many things manually, so they take a little more time to be ready, like a delicious home-made strawberry cake. 🍰</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, in a few minutes you should get your invoice from Stripe, our billing platform. And if you have any questions, shoot us an email at python@userstand.com</p>
  <p>See you soon!</p>
